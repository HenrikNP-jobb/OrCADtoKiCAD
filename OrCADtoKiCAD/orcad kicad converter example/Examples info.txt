Orcad and Kicad in respective folders. 
Both schematics printed to pdf for reference. Not neccesarily exact coordinate matches for lines and component placements.



Kicad schematic file .sch.  Human readable. 2424 lines. Drawn using kicad version 9.0

Orcad schematic file .dsn. Binary blob. Drawn using OrCAD version 23.1. Maybe parseable by c++ tool?
Using the dsn file directly is most elegant. But not worth a lot of extra hassle.

Orcad exported edif file: "EXAMPLE.EDF" Human readable. Maybe this format is easier? looks similar ish to kicad format.

Orcad exported xml: "example.xml". Looks a little messy? Might work.


Parsing a lot of component infomation is very valuable. Such as notefied number, vendor, vendor part number, min/max temperatures etc.
